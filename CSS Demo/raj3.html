    Today rich Web applications use a mix of Java Script and asynchronous communication 
    with the application server. This mechanism is also known as Ajax: Asynchronous 
    JavaScript and XML. The intent of Ajax is to exchange small pieces of data between the 
    browser and the application server, and in doing so, use partial page refresh instead of 
    reloading the entire Web page. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a powerful 
    Web development model for browser-based Web applications. Technologies that formthe 
    AJAX model, such as XML, JavaScript, HTTP, and XHTML, are individually widely used 
    and well known. However, AJAX combines these technologies to let Web pages retrieve 
    small amounts of data from the server without having to reload the entire page. This 
    capability makes Web pages more interactive and lets them behave like local applications. 
    Web 2.0 enabled by the Ajax architecture has given rise to a new level of user interactivity 
    through web browsers.
